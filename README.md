This is a POC for basic private (protected) routes and public route. With some custom hooks spicy

This includes:

A provider for handling the user session, in sync with localStorage: <SessionProvider />
Custom `Route` components: <ProtectedRoute /> and <PublicRoute />
Two custom hooks: useLogin() and useLogout()
A form with validation featuring Formik and Yup: <Login />
Some scafolding I like to use
Some helpers

Hope you enjoy it!
