This includes:

A provider for handling the user session, in sync with localStorage: <SessionProvider /></br>
Custom `Route` components: <ProtectedRoute /> and <PublicRoute /></br>
Two custom hooks: useLogin() and useLogout()</br>
A form with validation featuring Formik and Yup: <Login /></br>
Some scafolding I like to use</br>
Some helpers</br>

Hope you enjoy it!
